# Java Studies of Concurrency

This is the README.md for the Java Concurrency Studies

**************************************

A collection of java files writted to understand multithreading, interleaving, concurrency and synchronization. Uses monitors and semaphore. 

SeatBooking.java - A system where there are client threads that pick a seat at random (at a venue with N amounts of seats), then are served by clerk threads. Clerks use the synchronized "monitor" in order to book the seat for the client and issue them a ticket. This monitor is for not allowing double booking by the clerks.
